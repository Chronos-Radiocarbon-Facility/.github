Chronos is a radiocarbon dating laboratory at UNSW, Sydney. We are affiliated with the School of [Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/bees/about-us/facilities/chronos-radiocarbon-facility) and can be found within the Solid State Elemental Analysis Unit (SSEAU).

Our lab operates a mini carbon dating AMS system ([MICADAS](https://www.ionplus.ch/micadas)) to date carbon in samples from the last 50,000 years. We date thousands of samples a year from teams around the world, including ancient wood, lake sediments, peat, coral and shells from the last 50,000 years.

Repositories on this page contain code we use to explore and implement best-practice data processing procedures including radiocarbon error calculation and background determination. 

Please see our [webpage](https://www.analytical.unsw.edu.au/facilities/sseau/radiocarbon-laboratory) for more on the facility, along with information on sample submission and access costs.
